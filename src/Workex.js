				<h3><i>Projects</i></h3>
			</div>
			<div  className="PEC-Project">	
				<b>Photo-Electrochemical Cell Designing and Prototyping</b><br/>Dec2018-Mar2019<br/>In this work, various photovoltaic materials were experimented with for maximizing efficiency and preventing corrosion. Finally a protoytpe was sucessfuly tested in laboratory on which a viable product design for commercialization was devised. 
			</div>
			<div  className="Flow visualization">	
				<b>Flow visualization of Two-Dimensional Bodies using Hele-Shaw apparatus [Accepted by Springer Nature India]</b><br/>Jul2019-Dec2019<br/>This study examined the flow of air over the chosen aerodynamic models using Hele-Shaw apparatus. The models were geometrically scaled down and the investigation gave a clear understanding of flow phenomena in the proximity of the model. The flow parameters such as stagnation, separation and wake regimes were clearly captured for the aerofoil, trailer-tractor truck and an unconventional building at various Reynolds number.
			</div>
			<div className="Welding-Project">
				<b>Effect of Friction Stir Welding on aluminium alloy AA2024</b><br/>Dec2019-Mar2020<br/>Variation in the microstructure of aluminium AA2024 was observed at the stir welded section also, Heat Affected Zone(HAZ) was identified by variation in rockwell hardness number around the welded region.
			</div>
			<div className="Tool-Design">	
				<b>Design of fixture for T-joint pipe welding in accordance with a rotary automatic weld system.</b><br/>Aug2020-Nov2020<br/>In this work, innovative fixture for location and clamping of two pipes on a rotary weld system, for improving the manufacturing rate of the T-joint in pipes by welding was designed and analysed.
			</div>
			<div  className="Rapid-Prototyping">	
				<b>Effciency of different slicing methods in 3D-printing</b><br/>Aug2020-Nov2020<br/>In this work, optimization of the slicing processes were analysed, by comparing the coverage of different slicing methods for chosen simple and complex components, finally a theoritically advanced slicing algorithm was devised.
			</div>
			<div  className="Pipette-helper">	
				<b>Enhanced Pipette helper [New Product Developement]</b><br/>Jan2021-Present<br/>In this work, design of conventional pipette helpers was augmented by integration of better features with aim of improving efficiency and ease of usage also, provide indian lab technicians with a budget friendly made in india alternative to overprised exported product. 
			</div>
			<div  className="Epicyclic-gear">	
				<b>Design, Analysis and Parametric Optimization of Epicyclic Gears</b><br/>Feb2021-Present<br/>In this work, planetary gear train was designed which is used in automatic transmission in electric vehicles based on actual operational requirements. Further it was modelled in Fusion360 and simulated in ANSYS, the results were used for parameterization of the gear set. Based on the deductions parametric optimization was done in MATLAB and results concurred the relationships between different design parameters.
